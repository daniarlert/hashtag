# hashtag - An over-engineered way to choose hashtags

*hashtag* is a very simple tool for personal use to select and prepare more easily future posts for Instagram or other social media platforms.

## Usage

This project uses [charmbracelet/gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum), a tool to write more easily beautiful shell scripts. In order to use *hashtag* you'll need to install it following the instruction provided by them [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation).

To use `hashtag` you just need to clone this repo and execute it via:

```sh
sh ./hashtag
```

Now just write, as the prompt suggests, the title of your post and select the hashtags from the list using `space` to select/deselect and `enter` to confirm. And that's everything!
